git checkout HEAD road-not-taken.txt

//--- Adding this in 'road-not-taken.txt' file
And that has made all the difference.

git checkout -- 'road-not-taken.txt'

//--- Adding this in 'oven-bird.txt' file
Is what to make of a diminished thing.

//--- Adding this in 'fire-and-ice.txt' file
Is also okay
And would suffice.
