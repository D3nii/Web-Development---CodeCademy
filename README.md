# Web Developer Career Path - CodeCademy

Hello viewer, Welcome to the *repo*.



## Honor Code

I am leaving this open source on the honor system. Please do not plagarize my code! You will only learn by investing the time to work through the problems yourself!

Now, when thats out of the way, I'm completely fine with anyone copying and pasting *because thats what we all do.* 😏 

But in return, a *like* would be appreciated. 👊

I hope this helps! Also, if you find some faulty code, send a PR. 💪
